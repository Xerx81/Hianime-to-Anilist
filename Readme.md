# Hianime to Anilist

The default export.xml file of Hianime cannot be directly imported into Anilist. Therefore, I wrote this python script which can restructure the xml document so that it can be easily imported by Anilist.

## Usage:

#### Step 1:
- Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Xerx81/Hianime-to-Anilist.git
```

- Change the directory
```
cd Hianime-to-Anilist
```

- Put the export.xml file of Hianime in the same directory.

- Run the python file
```
python3 hianime_to_al.py
```

- "new_export.xml" file will be generated.
